I had one moment of weakness last month, when I logged into my other, private Twitter account, just to check in on what the 20 people I follow on that account had been up to recently. Within minutes I felt depressed, as I learned there was a conference canceled because people attacked it as a sexist speaker lineup and the organizers just folded rather than wade through the deluge of attacks or try to fix things, and then heard that Paul Campbell had received similar attacks on Ãšll last year. I just felt horrible for those organizers, and then for Paul, and there was nothing I could actually do other than feel bad. It served no one any benefit and it just derailed my evening.
